        <challengeSummary>
          Create a game of snake. The snake should start with length of 2 blocks, and move in the direction of "this.velocity" at every call of the game loop. An apple (a 1-block square with color "appleColor") should be randomly placed on the board, and when the snake eats the apple, the apple should be reset and the snake should grow by 1 block. If the snake runs into itself or the game border, the game should call "this.gameOver". The grid size is available as "this.numBlocks". lets go! Canvas API
